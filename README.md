**CHALLENGE:**
1. _Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word._
1. _Add a toolbar button that calls startGame(), so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to._
1. _Put a text view somewhere so you can track and show the playerâ€™s score for a given root word. How you calculate score is down to you, but something involving number of words and their letter count would be reasonable._
